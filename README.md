# MemeMe 2.0

![Application Icon](./AppIcon.png)

This repository contains the Udacity project **MemeMe 2.0** from the iOS Nanodegree.

## Overview

This Swift iOS application allows users to pick an image to use as the basis of a meme (either from their photos or from the device camera). Users can then edit TextFields at the top and bottom of the image using a meme-style typeface. When editing the lower TextField the image moves up so it is not blocked by the keyboard. Finally, users can share the finished meme image.

Version 2.0 saves generated memes and displays them to the user. Saved memes can be organized as a list or as a collection. Tabs allow the user to toggle between these views of the data.

## Setup

There are no special setup instructions, just build and run!
